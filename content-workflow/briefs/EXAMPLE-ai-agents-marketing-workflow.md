3. Success requires clear guidelines, context documents, and quality checks
4. Start small with one workflow before expanding across the organization

### Scope

  - What multi-agent workflows are and why they matter
  - Real example of a content workflow with writer and editor agents
  - How to set up context files (style guides, brand guidelines)
  - GitHub Actions automation for triggering agents
  - Collaboration considerations for teams
  - Practical tips for getting started
  
- **What to Exclude**: 
  - Deep technical details about AI models
  - Comparison of different AI providers
  - Cost analysis and pricing
  - Future predictions about AGI
  - Legal and ethical debates (save for separate article)
