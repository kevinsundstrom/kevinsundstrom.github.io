# Content Style Guide

This document serves as a reference for all content creation within this repository.

## Voice and Tone

- **Voice**: Professional yet approachable, authoritative without being condescending
- **Tone**: Conversational, clear, and engaging
- **Perspective**: Second person ("you") when addressing readers, first person ("I", "we") when sharing experiences

## Writing Principles

1. **Clarity First**: Write clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon unless it's standard in the field
2. **Active Voice**: Prefer active voice over passive voice
3. **Short Sentences**: Keep sentences concise and to the point
4. **Scannable**: Use headers, bullet points, and short paragraphs to make content easy to scan

## Formatting Standards

### Headers
- Use title case for H1 (main title)
- Use sentence case for H2 and H3
- Keep headers descriptive and actionable

### Lists
- Use bullet points for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists only when order matters
- Keep list items parallel in structure

### Links
- Use descriptive anchor text (avoid "click here")
- Link to authoritative sources
- Open external links in new tabs when appropriate

## Content Structure

### Introduction

- Keep it to 2-3 sentences

### Body
