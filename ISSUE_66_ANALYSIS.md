❌ **Issue 66 FAILED to remove the third paragraph as intended**  
⚠️ **The content from issue 66 is present, but the third paragraph was not removed**

## Correct Understanding of Issue 66

**Intent:** Remove the third paragraph from the article by providing only the first two paragraphs, expecting the entire article body to be replaced.

**Expected Result:** Article should contain only two paragraphs (the ones specified in issue 66).

**Actual Result:** Article contains the two paragraphs from issue 66 PLUS the third paragraph that should have been removed.

## Detailed Analysis

### Content Provided in Issue 66 (Intended Full Replacement):
```
Content strategy is a lot more nuanced than people believe. It's psychology and poetry, mixed with a tiny dash of calculus. If all that weren't complicated enough, it can't be executed in a silo—it's collaborative in nature. So consensus building is vital: you need other people to believe in your strategy so deeply that it influences the words that land on the page. When done well, you arrive at a draft that feels whole and connected.

But then, as always, stakeholders arrive. They operate on feeling and a sense of entitlement. Their gut is more powerful than your mind. Oh well, let's ship to learn, and then trust their gut next time anyway.
```

### Current Article Content:
The above content PLUS this paragraph that should have been REMOVED:
```
We can do better. Not by owning everything or adding more process, but by making it easier to collaborate meaningfully. A great content strategy doesn't demand control—it builds shared conviction. Less defending, more aligning. Less noise, more signal. And maybe, just maybe, better work that doesn't exhaust everyone along the way.
```

## Conclusion

Issue 66 **DID NOT** successfully change the article body text as intended. While the content specified in issue 66 is present in the current article, the automation failed to perform the intended removal operation. The third paragraph that was supposed to be removed is still present, indicating that the automation system did not correctly process the replacement operation.

**Root Cause:** The automation appears to have treated issue 66 as an addition rather than a complete replacement, failing to remove existing content as intended.
