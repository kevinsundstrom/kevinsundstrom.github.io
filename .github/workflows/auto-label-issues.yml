I detected that this issue appears to be an ${isEditIssue ? 'article edit' : 'article creation'} request but was missing the required "${labelToAdd}" label.

I've automatically added the "${labelToAdd}" label so the article automation workflow can process your request.

${isEditIssue ? 
  'Your article edit request will now be processed automatically.' : 
  'Your article will now be published automatically.'
}

*If this was added incorrectly, please remove the label and the automation won't run.*`;
