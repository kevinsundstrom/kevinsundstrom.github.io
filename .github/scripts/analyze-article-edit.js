 * Article Edit Analysis Tool
 * 
 * This tool can analyze any article edit issue to determine:
 * - Whether the issue was processed
 * - What content changes were requested vs what's currently published
 * - If there are discrepancies between requested and actual changes
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Issue 66 is a special case - it was intended as a REMOVAL operation
 * by providing only partial content, expecting complete replacement of the article body.
 * This tool handles such replacement operations differently from additive edits.
 * 
 * Usage: node analyze-article-edit.js <issue-number>
