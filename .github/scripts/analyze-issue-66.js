If all that weren't complicated enough, it can't be executed in a silo‚Äîit's collaborative in nature. So consensus building is vital: you need other people to believe in your strategy so deeply that it influences the words that land on the page. When done well, you arrive at a draft that feels whole and connected.

But then, as always, stakeholders arrive. They operate on feeling and a sense of entitlement. Their gut is more powerful than your mind. Oh well, let's ship to learn, and then trust their gut next time anyway.`;
